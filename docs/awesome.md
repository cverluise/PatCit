## Software and Libraries

- Grobid ([GitHub][grobid-gh], [Doc][grobid-doc], [Demo][grobid-demo]) is a machine learning library for extracting, parsing and re-structuring raw documents such as PDF into structured XML/TEI encoded documents with a particular focus on technical and scientific publications. First developments started in 2008 as a hobby. In 2011 the tool has been made available in open source. Work on GROBID has been steady as a side project since the beginning and is expected to continue as such.
- Biblio-glutton ([GitHub][biblio-glutton]) is a bibliographical reference matching service. From an input such as a raw bibliographical reference and/or a combination of key metadata, the service returns the disambiguated bibliographical object with in particular its DOI and a set of metadata aggregated from Crossref, PUBMED and other awesome bibliographical resources.
- spaCy ([GitHub][spaCy-gh], [Doc][spaCy-doc]) is an Industrial-Strength Natural Language Processing Python library.
- Doccano ([GitHub][doccano-gh], [Demo][doccano-demo]) is an open source text annotation tool for machine learning practitioners.

## Data

- [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org) interlinks millions of items from a variety of content types, including journals, books, conference proceedings, working papers, technical reports, and data sets. Linked content includes materials from Scientific, Technical and Medical (STM) and Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.
- [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is a free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics.
- [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org) is an open database of 25+ million free scholarly articles.
- [Lens.org](https://www.lens.org) is a free and open search platform for patents and scholarly articles.
