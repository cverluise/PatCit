## Found a bug?

If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to the [issue tracker][issue-tracker] in our GitHub repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. Before doing so, please read the submission guidelines.

## Missing a feature?

You are most welcome to request new features by submitting a [feature request][issue-tracker] to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit a proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of general interest.

## Submission guidelines

### Submitting an issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the custom issue template. Please stick to the issue template.

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. If you do not find a related issue or PR, go ahead!

## Git Commit Messages

Some good practices:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:

|emoji|`code`| task|

| :tada: |`:tada`| when adding code|
| :art: |`:art:`| when improving the format/structure of the code|
| :bug: |`:bug:`| when fixing a bug|
| :memo: |`:memo:`| when writing docs|
| :fire: |`:fire:`| when removing code or files|
| :gift: |`:gift:`| when adding features|
| :rainbow: |`:rainbow:`| when adding community content|
| :racehorse: |`:racehorse:`| when improving performance|
| :crystal_ball: |`:crystal_ball:`| when adding/improving a model|
| :white_check_mark: |`:white_check_mark:`| when adding validation results/data|
