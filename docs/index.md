# <small>Welcome to</small> PatCit

*Building a comprehensive dataset of patent citations*

Patents are at the crossroads of many innovation nodes: science, industry, products, competition, etc. Such interactions can be identified through citations in a broad sense.

It is now common to use front-page *patent* citations to study some aspects of the innovation system. **Good news, there is much more buried in the front-page Non Patent Literature (NPL) citations and in the patent text itself[^1]. patCit extracts and structures these citations.**
